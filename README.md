# spiralizer
A spiral-based visualization tool for sequence data. 

Specifically, this Processing code generates a visualization 
of sequence data using colored circles plotted along an Archimedean spiral.
Please read the comments for usage information.
  
Inspired by Martin Krzywinski's "Pi on a spiral":
